## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the FAA Wildlife Strikes dataset for the year 2015, aiming to understand its financial implications and uncover patterns related to wildlife strikes in aviation. The analysis is conducted using Tableau to create visualizations and address specific questions related to the dataset.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to thoroughly examine the FAA Wildlife Strikes dataset for the year 2015 and assess its financial implications. This involves the following key tasks:
1. **Develop Visualizations**: Create compelling visualizations in Tableau that highlight critical insights from the dataset, allowing for a deeper understanding of wildlife strikes and their financial impact.
2. **Identify Patterns and Trends**: Uncover recurring patterns and trends related to wildlife strikes by utilizing the dataset. By doing so, we aim to gain valuable insights into the factors influencing these incidents.
3. **Build Interactive Dashboard**: Construct an interactive Tableau dashboard that serves as a user-friendly platform for exploring the dataset. This dashboard will enable users to delve into the data, ask questions, and extract meaningful information about wildlife strikes in aviation.

## Process
1. **Examine the Dataset**: Start by thoroughly examining the FAA Wildlife Strikes dataset for 2015 to understand its structure and contents.
2. **Discover Inquiry Points**: Identify the questions and inquiries that can be answered using the available data.
3. **Visualize Key Insights**: Use Tableau to create informative visualizations that capture essential information, making it easier to understand the data.
4. **Analyze Relationships**: Investigate relationships and trends between aircraft strikes and wildlife incidents by conducting exploratory data analysis.
5. **Create Interactive Dashboard**: Develop an interactive Tableau dashboard to facilitate data exploration and gain deeper insights into the dataset.

## Results

### Dataset Analysis
The analysis is structured as follows:
1. Thorough examination of the dataset.
2. Identification of questions that can be answered using the available data.
3. Creation of informative visualizations to highlight key details.
4. Analysis of relationships and trends between wildlife strikes and aviation.
5. Development of an interactive dashboard for in-depth exploration.

### Visualizations
To convey our findings effectively, we have used various visualizations:
- **Dual Line Chart**: Comparing collisions vs. cost by dates and forecasting future trends.
- **Side-by-Side Bar Chart**: Displaying the number of strikes per state alongside total costs.
- **Tree Maps**: Depicting the number of strikes by time of day in comparison to other times.
- **Dual Bar Chart**: Illustrating strike costs vs. species type, highlighting high-cost species.
- **Bar Chart**: Representing the average strike cost by time of day.

### Key Findings
Our analysis revealed several key findings, including:
- An increase in wildlife strikes over time.
- Birds as the dominant category responsible for most strikes.
- Trends indicating significant impact but no direct relationship between strike occurrence and damage costs.

### Critical Questions Addressed
During our analysis, we explored five pivotal questions, each providing valuable insights into wildlife strikes in aviation and their related costs, trends, and causes:

1. **State Incidence**: Which states experienced higher incidences of wildlife strikes?

2. **Species Impact and Cost**: What are the most affected animal species, and what are the associated costs?

3. **State-Specific Costs**: How does the cost of these strikes vary by state?

4. **Collision Costs Over Time**: What is the collision cost pattern over time, and what can we forecast for the future?

5. **Incident Frequency by Time**: How do wildlife strike incidents vary in frequency at different times of the day?

Explore these questions and their insights further using our interactive dashboard for a deeper understanding of wildlife strikes in aviation.

## Challenges
Initially, one of the primary challenges I faced was the organization and formulation of meaningful questions to guide my analysis effectively. Additionally, a desire to categorize airports into international, private, and commercial segments emerged as a challenge, which could have provided further insights into the dataset.

## Future Goals
In my ongoing pursuit of insightful data analysis, my future goals include expanding the scope of my analysis. I plan to achieve this by creating additional graphics and visualizations to enhance data representation. Furthermore, I aim to craft a compelling narrative that highlights the relevance of the data and emphasizes key findings. Looking ahead, I also intend to incorporate other related datasets, such as customer experiences or sentiments resulting from wildlife strikes, into my analysis. This expanded dataset integration will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of wildlife strikes in aviation.
