# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project Objective:

Our objective is to thoroughly examine the FAA Wildlife Strikes dataset for the year 2015 and assess its financial implications.
Tasks:
1. **Develop Visualizations**: Create compelling visualizations in Tableau that highlight critical insights from the dataset.

2. **Identify Patterns and Trends**: Uncover recurring patterns and trends related to wildlife strikes by utilizing the dataset.

3. **Build Interactive Dashboard**: Construct an interactive Tableau dashboard to address inquiries and provide a user-friendly platform for exploring the dataset.

## Process

1. **Examine the Dataset**: Start by thoroughly examining the FAA Wildlife Strikes dataset for 2015 to understand its structure and contents.

2. **Discover Inquiry Points**: Identify the questions and inquiries that can be answered using the available data.

3. **Visualize Key Insights**: Use Tableau to create informative visualizations that capture essential information, making it easier to understand the data.

4. **Analyze Relationships**: Investigate relationships and trends between aircraft strikes and wildlife incidents by conducting exploratory data analysis.

5. **Create Interactive Dashboard**: Develop an interactive Tableau dashboard to facilitate data exploration and gain deeper insights into the dataset.

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the FAA Wildlife Strikes dataset for the year 2015, aiming to understand its financial implications and uncover patterns related to wildlife strikes in aviation. The analysis is conducted using Tableau to create visualizations and address specific questions related to the dataset.

## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to:
- Thoroughly examine the FAA Wildlife Strikes dataset for 2015.
- Assess the financial impact of wildlife strikes.
- Create meaningful visualizations in Tableau.
- Identify patterns and trends related to wildlife strikes.
- Develop an interactive dashboard to answer questions related to the dataset.

## Dataset Analysis
The analysis is structured as follows:
1. Thorough examination of the dataset.
2. Identification of questions that can be answered using the available data.
3. Creation of informative visualizations to highlight key details.
4. Analysis of relationships and trends between wildlife strikes and aviation.
5. Development of an interactive dashboard for in-depth exploration.

## Visualizations
To convey our findings effectively, we have used various visualizations:
- **Dual Line Chart**: Comparing collisions vs. cost by dates and forecasting future trends.
- **Side-by-Side Bar Chart**: Displaying the number of strikes per state alongside total costs.
- **Tree Maps**: Depicting the number of strikes by time of day in comparison to other times.
- **Dual Bar Chart**: Illustrating strike costs vs. species type, highlighting high-cost species.
- **Bar Chart**: Representing the average strike cost by time of day.

## Key Findings
Our analysis revealed several key findings, including:
- An increase in wildlife strikes over time.
- Birds as the dominant category responsible for most strikes.
- Trends indicating significant impact but no direct relationship between strike occurrence and damage costs.

## Problem Questions
We addressed critical questions during our analysis:
1. Will the cost of repairs increase over time as the number of wildlife strikes increases?
2. Will the duration of aircraft out-of-service increase over time with more wildlife strikes?
3. Can we identify the main causes of high wildlife strikes at the state level or airports?

These findings offer valuable insights into wildlife strikes in aviation and their associated costs, trends, and causes.

Feel free to explore the interactive dashboard to dive deeper into the dataset and gain further insights.
