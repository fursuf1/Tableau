## Project Objective:

Our objective is to thoroughly examine the FAA Wildlife Strikes dataset for the year 2015 and assess its financial implications.
Tasks:
1. **Develop Visualizations**: Create compelling visualizations in Tableau that highlight critical insights from the dataset.

2. **Identify Patterns and Trends**: Uncover recurring patterns and trends related to wildlife strikes by utilizing the dataset.

3. **Build Interactive Dashboard**: Construct an interactive Tableau dashboard to address inquiries and provide a user-friendly platform for exploring the dataset.

## Process

1. **Examine the Dataset**: Start by thoroughly examining the FAA Wildlife Strikes dataset for 2015 to understand its structure and contents.

2. **Discover Inquiry Points**: Identify the questions and inquiries that can be answered using the available data.

3. **Visualize Key Insights**: Use Tableau to create informative visualizations that capture essential information, making it easier to understand the data.

4. **Analyze Relationships**: Investigate relationships and trends between aircraft strikes and wildlife incidents by conducting exploratory data analysis.

5. **Create Interactive Dashboard**: Develop an interactive Tableau dashboard to facilitate data exploration and gain deeper insights into the dataset.
